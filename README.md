## What is GROWTH MINDSET?

Growth mindset is the understanding that intelligence (that is, the individual's capacity to learn and deploy cognitive skills), is not fixed. We are not born with a bucket of potential to fill. Instead, intelligence is something that can be built. Education is not the filling of a bucket but the lighting of a spark.

### How to STAY in GROWTH MINDSET
1. Do a little each day
2. Remember the words of Odysseus: "Patience, my heart. You have been through fouler than this."
3. Remember why you're doing this.
